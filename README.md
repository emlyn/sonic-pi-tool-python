Sonic Pi Tool (Python)
=============

`sonic-pi-tool.py` is a rewrite of the Rust [sonic-pi-tool](https://github.com/lpil/sonic-pi-tool) in Python.

It has now been moved to [emlyn/sonic-pi-tool](https://github.com/emlyn/sonic-pi-tool) so that it doesn't appear as a fork,
as it is a rewrite of the original.
